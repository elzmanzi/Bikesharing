### New York Bike data using Tableau 
During this analysis we are going to explore bikes data for the city of New York, we will be looking into deep understanding on where our users are based on starting point, how long do they utilize the bike,trip duration by gender,  what is our busiest time window in order to find the best maintenance time and so on.

- during the analysis, the trip duration is almost 20 min, and the busies hours are between 5-7PM,
## Summary
In summary, we will need to consider the bike utilization based on bikeID, if a bike is mostly used we can consider increasing the number of bikes to that specific location.
